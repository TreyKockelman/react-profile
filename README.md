# React Profile - Trey Kockelman

  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this project is to create a profile with React to display my skills learned thus far as a developer. There were some struggles with this project as it was my first project with React. I could not get the form to validate but everything else went smoothly just took a bit of time to finish.
